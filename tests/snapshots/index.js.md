    ::set-output name=text::Because air molecules scatter sunlight, and they scatter short wavelengths (blues/violets) much more strongly than long wavelengths (reds). This effect, called Rayleigh scattering, goes roughly as 1/(wavelength^4). The scattered blue light comes to us from all directions, making the sky look blue.%0A%0AWe don’t see a violet sky because:%0A- Our eyes are less sensitive to violet than blue.%0A- Some violet/UV light is absorbed in the upper atmosphere.%0A%0AAt sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels a longer path through the air, so most blue light is scattered out before reaching you; the remaining direct light is richer in reds and oranges. If the sky looks whitish, larger particles (haze, dust) are causing Mie scattering, which is less wavelength-selective.␊
